# ticketing-systems-home-lab


Another personal project in continuation of simulating real-world IT tasks. Learning ticketing systems is beneficial in organizing clients' technical issues and informing the IT team altogether. We will be using a free, open-source ticketing system called Peppermint. https://peppermint.sh/
Credits to **NetworkChuck** for providing a tutorial video on how to set up Peppermint. https://youtu.be/Kq0BMVhbFkA?si=2YwljM3wolAYXDQR
