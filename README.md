# ticketing-systems-home-lab


Another personal project in continuation of simulating real-world IT tasks. Learning ticketing systems is beneficial in organizing clients' technical issues, informing the IT team altogether and hoping to resolve issues as soon as possible. We will be using a free, open-source ticketing system called Peppermint. https://peppermint.sh/
